# User Advice and Disclaimers for secure pratices

### 1. Security Advice

FortiVault Password Manager is designed to keep your passwords and sensitive information safe through strong encryption and secure storage methods. However, **no security solution is foolproof** if you do not adhere to basic security practices. Here are some key recommendations to keep your data safe:

- **Avoid downloading suspicious apps and files**: Malware or spyware can be disguised as harmless files or apps. Only download from trusted sources and always verify the legitimacy of an application.
  
- **Do not click on strange or unknown links**: Phishing attacks are a common way hackers steal your personal information. Never click on links from unknown senders or suspicious websites.

- **Be cautious when using public Wi-Fi**: Public Wi-Fi networks are often unsecured, making it easy for attackers to intercept your data. Avoid accessing sensitive information or logging into secure accounts when connected to public Wi-Fi.

- **Keep your device software and FortiVault updated**: Regular updates provide important security patches and improvements. Always keep your operating system, applications, and FortiVault Password Manager up to date.

- **Use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts**: A strong password should be long, complex, and unique. Avoid using common passwords or repeating the same password across multiple accounts.

**Remember**: FortiVault provides robust encryption and security, but it cannot protect you from poor security habits. Stay vigilant and be mindful of your online activities.

### 2. Don't Share Your Backup Codes

Backup codes in FortiVault are the cornerstone of your data security. If someone gains access to your backup codes, they could potentially decrypt and access all of your stored passwords and sensitive information. Here are some important considerations:

- **Store your backup codes securely**: Use a secure method, such as a hardware-based password manager, a secure notes app, or even a physically locked safe. Avoid storing them in plaintext on your device or cloud storage.

- **Do not share your backup codes with anyone**: Treat your backup codes like the keys to your house. Sharing them with others puts your passwords and sensitive data at risk. Even if someone claims to be from a support team or trusted source, **never share these codes**.

- **Understand how FortiVault uses your backup codes**: The encryption of your data is based on these backup codes, which are randomly generated and unique to your instance of FortiVault. While the encryption logic is strong and nearly impossible to crack, if an attacker has your backup codes, they have the "key" to your data.

### 3. Open Source Disclaimer

FortiVault is an **open-source project**, which means the code is available for anyone to review, contribute to, and modify. This transparency promotes trust and collaboration but also means that:

- **FortiVault's developers and contributors are not responsible** for any loss of data or security breaches that occur due to user negligence or disregard for safety advice.

- The **responsibility for security lies with the user**: While we provide a secure environment for your data, it is up to you to follow best practices, keep your device and software up to date, and safeguard your backup keys and sensitive information.

- **Regularly review the source code and community contributions**: Being an open-source project, it's essential to stay updated on the latest changes, updates, and potential vulnerabilities that the community discovers and addresses.

### 4. Don't Lose Your Backup Keys

Your backup keys are the **only way to recover your data** if you lose access to your FortiVault Password Manager. There is no centralized recovery service, as FortiVault is designed to keep your data entirely in your control. Here’s what you need to know:

- **Losing your backup keys means losing access to your data**: If you lose these keys, you will not be able to recover your encrypted data. Unlike cloud-based password managers, FortiVault does not have a "forgot password" feature because your data is stored locally and encrypted based on your keys.

- **Make multiple secure backups of your keys**: Consider keeping your backup keys in more than one secure location, such as a hardware token, a fireproof safe, or even securely with a trusted individual. 

- **Be mindful of hardware failures or device loss**: If your backup keys are stored on a single device that gets damaged or lost, you lose access to your data. Always plan for contingencies.

- **We cannot recover your data for you**: The very security of FortiVault relies on the fact that we have no access to your data or keys. This decentralized approach ensures maximum privacy and security, but it also means that you must take full responsibility for managing and safeguarding your recovery keys.

Sure! Below are some additional pertinent topics to include in the security advice and disclaimers, continuing after the fourth topic:

### 5. Understand and Manage Your Encryption

FortiVault relies on **strong encryption algorithms** to protect your data. However, understanding how encryption works and managing your encryption keys properly is crucial to maintaining your security:

- **Know the type of encryption used**: FortiVault uses industry-standard encryption algorithms such as AES-256 to ensure your data is secure. Make sure you understand how these work and why they are considered secure.

- **Regularly update your encryption keys**: For added security, consider periodically rotating or regenerating your encryption keys. This can help mitigate potential risks if a key is compromised.

- **Never use weak or easily guessable keys**: Ensure that any passwords or keys you use are strong and unique. Avoid using common phrases, names, or simple patterns that could be easily guessed or brute-forced by attackers.

- **Be cautious with third-party plugins or tools**: If you are using any additional tools to manage your encryption or interact with FortiVault data, ensure they are reputable and do not compromise your security. Third-party tools can sometimes introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors.

### 6. Device Security and Environment Awareness

The security of your FortiVault data also heavily relies on the **security of the device** on which it is installed and the environment in which it is used:

- **Secure your device with a strong password or biometric protection**: Make sure your device is protected with a secure password, PIN, or biometric method (like fingerprint or facial recognition).

- **Use encryption for your entire device**: Enable full-disk encryption on your device to protect all data, including FortiVault files, in case of device theft or loss.

- **Be aware of physical security risks**: Always be cautious of your surroundings when entering sensitive information or unlocking your FortiVault app. Shoulder-surfing and other physical attacks can compromise your data.

- **Avoid using public or shared computers**: Never use FortiVault on a public or shared device, as these can have malicious software installed or be monitored.

### 7. Data Backup Best Practices

While FortiVault does not store your data in the cloud, you may still need to back up your encrypted data securely:

- **Use a trusted and secure backup method**: Always back up your encrypted data to a secure location. This could be an encrypted external hard drive, a secure USB stick, or a dedicated offline storage solution.

- **Ensure your backup location is safe and inaccessible to unauthorized users**: Just as you would protect your primary device, ensure that your backup media is stored securely and inaccessible to unauthorized users.

- **Regularly test your backups**: Periodically test your backup and recovery process to ensure that your data can be restored correctly and remains usable.

### 8. Monitor for Suspicious Activity

Even with strong security measures in place, it's important to **stay vigilant** and monitor for any suspicious activity that could indicate a security breach:

- **Monitor logs for unusual activity**: If you notice any unusual logins, accesses, or changes to your FortiVault data, investigate immediately.

- **Enable notifications for key actions**: Set up notifications for important actions like new device registrations, data exports, or key changes. This way, you’ll be immediately alerted if anything unusual happens.

- **Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) whenever possible**: While FortiVault is designed to be a self-contained application, always enable MFA for any associated services or devices for an extra layer of security.

### 9. Understand Your Role in Security

FortiVault is a tool that provides strong security, but it is up to you, the user, to use it responsibly:

- **Take ownership of your security**: Understand that no tool can make up for careless behavior or ignoring basic security principles. FortiVault is designed to give you full control, and with that control comes responsibility.

- **Stay informed about security practices**: The cybersecurity landscape is always evolving. Stay informed about the latest threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices to ensure your data remains safe.

- **Educate yourself and others**: Share knowledge about secure password management, data protection, and encryption with friends, family, and colleagues. A security-aware community is more resilient to attacks.

### 10. Disclaimer of Liability

As a user of FortiVault, it is crucial to understand that:

- **You are solely responsible for your data**: FortiVault and its contributors provide a tool to secure your passwords and sensitive information, but the use, management, and backup of that data are entirely your responsibility.

- **No guarantees of absolute security**: While FortiVault aims to provide the highest level of security, no software or tool can guarantee absolute protection against all potential threats or vulnerabilities.
