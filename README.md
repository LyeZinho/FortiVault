# FortiVault

**FortiVault** is a decentralized password manager designed to keep your credentials secure by eliminating reliance on central servers. Built with a focus on privacy and security, FortiVault uses cutting-edge technology to ensure that your sensitive information is stored and synchronized safely across devices without the need for large data centers or third-party servers.

## Why FortiVault?

In recent years, data breaches have exposed millions of passwords and sensitive information from major databases. For instance:

- **Equifax Data Breach (2017)**: Over 147 million records, including sensitive personal information, were compromised.
- **Yahoo Data Breaches (2013-2014)**: A series of breaches resulted in over 3 billion accounts being compromised.
- **LastPass Security Incident (2022)**: Exposed data from a password manager raised concerns about password security and encryption practices.

These incidents highlight the risks associated with storing personal data on centralized servers. Large data centers, while providing convenience, are also lucrative targets for cybercriminals. FortiVault mitigates these risks by employing a decentralized approach, ensuring that your passwords are stored and managed on your own devices, not in vulnerable data centers.

## Features

- **Decentralized Storage:** Passwords are stored locally on your device and synchronized across devices using a peer-to-peer network.
- **Strong Encryption:** AES encryption ensures that your data is securely encrypted and protected from unauthorized access.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enhance security with MFA, including biometric options.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Available for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.
- **Backup and Recovery:** Secure backups and recovery options to safeguard against data loss.
